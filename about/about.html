              TANGENTS <br>
            <br>
This is a place for architectural instigations — projects that sometimes start with a real brief or client, sometimes with nothing more than a question. 
      They may follow the path laid out, or wander into unexpected territory, taking tangents that grow from other work. 
      Each is both exploration and provocation: a way to test ideas, materials, and the edges of possibility. 
      Some could be built; others exist only as drawings or concepts. 
      Together they form an ongoing record of following curiosity wherever it leads, and treating design as a way to keep asking, what else might be possible?
